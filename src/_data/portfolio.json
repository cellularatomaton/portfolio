The back-end server operates independently, handling market state management and strategy execution, while the front-end built with Create React App (CRA) provides a user-friendly interface to monitor live data and control the market-making strategy. A significant challenge during development was IP blocking by Bybit, which was overcome by using a Google Cloud Run instance with a static outbound IP for testing. The front-end allows users to start market-making once they press the 'Start' button, and the back-end strategy server provides updates every 100ms.

The project consists of two main components: a server for processing the portfolio logic and a client for displaying the results. The server connects to the CoinMarketCap API, retrieves market cap data, and calculates the portfolio weights accordingly. It then broadcasts the results to the client, which can be used to view the portfolio breakdown, including the market cap percentage and the amount of each cryptocurrency to hold. The tool also allows for flexibility in portfolio customization, such as selecting specific coins to include or exclude from the portfolio. To get started, users can install the dependencies, set up their environment variables, and run the server and client locally.

However, barriers to entry such as limited access to capital, reliance on predatory loans, and the influence of well-funded investors have hindered the success of SECs, threatening the original intent of the legislation. Cognitive Harmony Technologies, in partnership with Perception Farms, proposes a blockchain-based solution using smart contracts and a DAO to help SECs avoid predatory practices and protect their equity, ensuring the fair distribution of cannabis business licenses.",
        "details": "EquiSeed EST & DAO is a blockchain-based solution designed to address the funding and financial challenges faced by Social Equity Companies (SECs) in the Illinois cannabis industry. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act (CRTA) was passed with the goal of promoting long-term wealth creation for communities that have been disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs. SECs, which include individuals from Disproportionately Impacted Areas (DIAs) or those with cannabis-related records, are given a competitive advantage in the cannabis licensing process through a 20% increase in their application scores. However, despite these advantages, SECs face significant barriers to entry, particularly in securing the capital needed for business development and build-out, which often forces them to rely on predatory investors and loan structures that undermine their long-term success.\nThe EquiSeed platform aims to solve these issues by using blockchain technology, specifically through the issuance of the EquiSeed Token (EST) and the governance of the transactions via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The EST represents debt from SECs to token holders, providing a decentralized and transparent way to fund cannabis businesses while protecting SECs from the predatory financial practices they currently face. The smart contracts associated with the DAO ensure that all financial transactions are automated and governed by the community, with SECs able to access funding without having to give up significant equity or fall prey to high-interest loans. This decentralized lending model allows SECs to secure the necessary capital for their businesses while maintaining control and ownership, thus aligning with the spirit of the CRTA.\nThe EquiSeed DAO is governed by a decentralized community of stakeholders, with each token holder entitled to vote on decisions related to loan approvals and platform governance. This structure allows the community to oversee and ensure the platform operates transparently, effectively, and fairly. SECs applying for loans must sign a Tokenization Agreement, which secures their loan with their cannabis business license as collateral. The platform will also include an EquiSeed Oracle to provide real-world data to the smart contracts and ensure stable coin swaps and loan paybacks. The long-term goal is to create a resilient, decentralized finance ecosystem that supports SECs in Illinois and potentially other states, helping them compete with larger, well-capitalized cannabis companies in a rapidly evolving market. Through this innovative approach, EquiSeed aims to democratize cannabis industry ownership, ensuring that the benefits of cannabis legalization reach those most affected by its criminalization."

        "details": "ArbMageddon is a cryptocurrency arbitrage toolset built using Node.js, designed to identify and exploit arbitrage opportunities across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. The project is divided into three main components: the common module, the server, and the single-page application (SPA). The common module contains the core functionality of the system, including models, trading strategies, exchange integrations, and pricing logic, which are shared across the other components. This module forms the backbone of the toolset, ensuring that all exchanges and trading strategies are consistently managed and executed. The server component, which runs on an Express server, hosts an instance of the asset graph built from the common module, and facilitates communication with the user interface through WebSocket or HTTP endpoints. This setup allows for real-time updates and synchronization between the backend and frontend components.\nThe backend server is responsible for managing the connections to various cryptocurrency exchanges, ensuring that the system is always up-to-date with the latest market data. By connecting to these exchanges, the server builds the asset graph, which represents the arbitrage opportunities available across multiple platforms. The server component is highly modular, enabling it to integrate with a variety of exchanges, and is designed to handle high-frequency trading scenarios with minimal latency. It also provides HTTP and WebSocket endpoints for communication, enabling real-time data flow to the user interface. To launch the server, users must install dependencies and run the server with debugging enabled, ensuring a smooth setup and operation for arbitrage activities.\nThe frontend is built as a single-page application (SPA) using modern JavaScript frameworks, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. The SPA allows users to visualize the asset graph and manage their trades, displaying real-time arbitrage opportunities, and offering features such as hot-reloading during development and production-level minification for efficient deployment. The setup for the SPA is straightforward, involving the installation of dependencies and running the application locally. The SPA communicates with the backend via WebSocket or HTTP, providing seamless interaction with the arbitrage toolset. ArbMageddon offers a comprehensive solution for cryptocurrency traders looking to take advantage of price discrepancies between exchanges, making it easier to automate and execute arbitrage strategies with minimal manual intervention."
