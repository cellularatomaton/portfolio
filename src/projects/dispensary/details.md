Late 2024: A ray of hope appeared with a promising location in McHenry. Excitement grew as the deal progressed. However, the McHenry deal collapsed, leaving the team disheartened after three years of developing the dispensary license.

The McHenry deal initially showed promise, with positive interactions with city officials and indications of support for the dispensary. The City of McHenry even included Perception Cannabis on their consent agenda for an upcoming meeting.

However, the situation deteriorated when we unable to reach terms.  Despite this, we expressed continued interest in the McHenry location. However, the potential partner decided to withdraw.

Despite this setback, we remained determined to bring Perception Cannabis to McHenry, indicating that we had identified alternative locations and were in contact with city officials. We also engaged legal counsel to draft contingency language for the lease agreement to protect our interests in case of unforeseen circumstances.

Despite this, our resilience and adaptability allowed us to explore alternative avenues and continue our pursuit of establishing a dispensary.
