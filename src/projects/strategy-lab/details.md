# Strategy Lab

## Project Description
The **Strategy Lab** project focused on the development and optimization of high-frequency trading systems for the futures and options markets. This initiative leveraged **Java**, **Python**, and **C++** to ensure low-latency performance and scalability. A key component of the project was the design and deployment of a custom suite for market analytics, system automation, and data visualization, utilizing the **MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) with a Python and Docker-based backend.

### Key Features:
1. **Graphical Flow-Based Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**:
   - Allowed traders to visually design trading strategies before writing code.
   - Facilitated the creation and manipulation of components and connections through a graphical interface.
   - Simplified strategy replication and ensured type safety during runtime.

2. **Market Analytics and Visualization**:
   - Included tools for data visualization and inline sampling of market data.
   - Provided profiling components to log and analyze market activity.

3. **Backend Infrastructure**:
   - Integrated disparate systems using **RabbitMQ** as a messaging middle layer, ensuring seamless communication between components.
   - Offered low-level system access through a **C++ plugin model** for high-performance operations.

4. **Python Integration**:
   - Utilized Boost Python for scripting interfaces, enabling flexible command and control.
   - Fully interactive Python console for sandboxed runtime environments, allowing real-time adjustments to strategies.

5. **Component Library**:
   - Centralized definitions in `library.json` for port and component metadata.
   - Enabled import/export of strategy configurations as JSON objects, facilitating easy sharing and deployment.

### Architecture:
- **Frontend**: Built with **Angular.js** for an interactive graphical user interface.
- **Backend**: Python and Docker-based, integrated with MongoDB for data storage and RabbitMQ for messaging.
- **Messaging**: Supported dynamic message types and a wide range of protocol integrations, including JSON, RMQ, and more.

### Contributions:
- Designed and implemented a flow-based DSL for trading strategy development.
- Developed a high-performance backend infrastructure using Docker and Python for analytics and data processing.
- Integrated RabbitMQ for robust inter-component messaging, enabling real-time system automation.
- Created tools for market data visualization and strategy optimization, enhancing operational efficiency.

### Outcomes:
- **Efficiency**: Reduced code duplication and boilerplate through automated code generation and modular design.
- **Scalability**: Improved platform scalability with support for dynamic message types and global strategy deployment.
- **Usability**: Simplified trading strategy development and deployment with a user-friendly interface and real-time system control.

Strategy Lab serves as a groundbreaking tool for trading teams, combining cutting-edge technology with innovative design to streamline trading operations and enhance market responsiveness.
